        <h2 class="section__title--reflection">General reflections and learning outcomes</h2>
        <p>
            I have learned to code more efficiently, more about how to use BEM correctly and how to use SCSS. I’ve also become better at just 
            knowing what to do and how to implement it. For the first obligatory, I would’ve renamed the classes, so they align more with BEM.
            For the second obligatory, I would’ve optimized the SVGs and maybe used CSS drawing for the background. For the third obligatory, 
            I would’ve made sure the “actions” part of the page were more readable and aesthetically pleasing. 
        </p>    
        <p>  
            Using BEM methodology makes it easier to target elements in SCSS, but it can be difficult to use the correct name. Using atomic 
            design makes it easier to remember how a page is structured, but can be difficult to understand if you didn’t do well in natural 
            sciences.

        <h2 class="section__title--reflection">Individual development and reflection</h2>
        <p>
            On the first assignment, I made the 1st screenshot into a webpage and tried to use SCSS and BEM to the best of my abilities.
            On the second assignment, I made the path the car follows and made the car follow the path, the text-curve and the stars twinkle.
            On the third assignment, I messed around with the view-width value to make the page responsive and wrote major parts of README 
            file. The other two were so quick (Vilja and Hanna), that anything I thought to implement or do, was already done before I could 
            finish my thought.

                <h3>Obligatory 1</h3>
                <p>
                    I moved the grid to the middle of the page and made minor adjustments so texts would line up better. I made the cards a 
                    little smaller, as well as the search bar. I changed some of the class names to align better with the BEM-methodology, 
                    but I know that some of them aren’t named properly still. All these changes were made to make the website look more like 
                    the original, but I’m still not that happy about it. 
                </p>
            </article>

            <article class="section__article--article">
                <h3>Obligatory 2</h3>
                <p>
                    I removed the eyes of the earth by removing the paths that made up the eyes from the HTML. I then added four div-elements 
                    to remake the eyes using CSS drawing, two for the black part and two for the white part. I then used some funny 
                    border-radius properties to make the white shines squigglier. I also fixed the slight horizontal scroll. All these changes 
                    were made so the obligatory met all the requirements of the original assignment.
                </p>

            <article class="section__article--article">
                <h3>Obligatory 3</h3>
                <p>
                    I started by removing the snap effect because it messed too much with the SVGs and annoyed me a lot. After that, I added a 
                    gradient background so the pages would flow better into each other. I changed some class names to fit the BEM-methodology 
                    better so it would work with SCSS. Some of that led to the need to switch some things around in the HTML, but changing some 
                    of the class names fixed a lot of my problems. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I added different bullet points to make the actions page more visually interesting. Some of the keywords of the points were 
                    highlighted, so that you could only read those and still know what you could do about the situation. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I put the SVGs that were supposed to be on top of the “background” SVGs, like the tractor, smoke and clouds, back. 
                    The animations of the logos were removed to make it less happy-go-lucky. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    For reduced motion, I slowed down most of the animations, and changed the JavaScript GSAP animation for the raining 
                    clothes to keyframes in CSS, so I could make a reduced motion version easier. To reduce the motion of the clothing rain, 
                    I made it into more of a background that slowly fades away.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I chose to not make the list of actions interactive, change some of the children to look different and change any colours 
                    in general due to time restrictions. I kept the clothes coming in with and getting dumped by the tractor as they were, 
                    because I think the visual que of the clothes being added to the pile is still there, despite them being set to disappear.

    <article class="section__article--reflection">
        <h2 class="section__title--reflection">Accessability reflection</h2>
        <p>
            As obligatory 1 and 2 is predetermined in terms of looks, I’ll assume that finn.no has the accessibility down and the posters 
            look isn’t anything I can do much about. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I checked obligatory 3 using the Achromeatic extension on chrome, and everything looked alright, except for high contrast. In the 
            updated version, I have added the media query for reduced motion, so the page is also usable for those who struggle with motion 
            sickness and other motion related illnesses.

    <article class="section__article--reflection">
        <h2 class="section__title--reflection">sustainability reflection</h2>
        <p>
            All the projects have inline SVGs that take up a lot of lines. In obligatory 2, this seems to especially cause the page to load 
            slowly, since we didn’t optimize the SVGs properly. That’s bad for the environment, but SVGs doesn’t take up as much storage as, 
            say a PNG. I’ve coded after the DRY principles as much as I was capable of, which reduces the amounts of lines used.
